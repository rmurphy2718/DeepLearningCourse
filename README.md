# Course Project: Variational Inference for Convolutional Neural Networks

In this course project, we evaluate weight pruning in a Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network fit with a [Bayes-by-Backprop](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.05424) approach.
We follow the [GitHub code](https://github.com/felix-laumann/Bayesian_CNN) provided by the authors of Bayesian CNN: *K. Shridhar, and F. Laumann, and A. Llopart Maurin, A. and M. Liwicki* (please see bibtex below)
